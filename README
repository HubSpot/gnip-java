Welcome to the Java client library for Gnip!

This Java API provides easy access to Gnip for Java developers.  

To build the library, run:

  mvn compile

To test the library, create the file:

  src/test/resources/test.properties

which holds the username, password, and host properties used to
connect to Gnip.  This file should be of the format:

gnip.username=darthvader
gnip.password=goempire
gnip.host=https://s.gnipcentral.com
gnip.publisher=apublisheryouown
# the number of seconds to wait between each test's setup / teardown
gnip.idlesecs=2 

Note, the JUnit tests publish activities to a Publisher.  You can only own publish
activities to a Publisher when you own it, so create a Publisher and provide its
name above in the "gnip.publisher" property.

To test the library, run:

  mvn test

To package the library, run:

  mvn package

To clean the library, run:

  mvn clean
